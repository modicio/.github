modicio is an open-source organisation to maintain the same named **modicio** framework and related projects. 

* :computer: **modicio** contains the main framework implementation.
* :computer: **codi-native** contains the (no longer maintained) CoDI-pattern reference implementation. The code has moved to the modicio main repository
* :book: **modicio-docs** contains the generated ScalaDoc github page of the modicio framework, maintained by our bot.
* :rocket: **modicio-insights** contains a ready-to-run starter project base on codi-native/modicio, scala and the playframework.
* 🚀 **issue-board** contains the Issue-Board research case study.
* 💻 **feature-dsl-tools** contains the Xtext tooling for a model evolution language on top of modicio's functionality

A quick-start regarding **modicio** can be found in out [getting-started guide](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki/Getting-Started)

General information are documented in our [wiki](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki).

### Roadmap

A goal for future work was to keept the codi-native reference implementation as a clean snapshot. Consequently, extensions as stated in our wiki and/or issue board will not become part of the codi-native codebase. Instead, we develop and maintain all new features as part of the the **modicio** framework. The final goal is to grow our concept into a full runtime-variable modelling framework for eternal system development.
